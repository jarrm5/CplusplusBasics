You have just purchased a stereo system that cost $1000 on the following credit plan:
No down payment, an interest rate of 18% per year (1.5% per month), and monthly payments of $50.
The monthly payment of $50 is used to pay the interest, and whatever is left is used to pay part
of the remaining debt (you pay 1.5% of $1000 in interest on the first month - $15 in interest).  
The remaining $35 is deducted from your debt, which leaves you with a debt of $965. The next month you pay
interest of 1.5% of $965, which is $14.84. You can then deduct $35.52 ($50 - $14.84) from the amount owed.

The program should tell how many months it will take to pay off the loan, as well as the total amount of
interest paid over the life of the loan.
